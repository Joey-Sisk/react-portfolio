## Description

This portfolio was created with react and incorporates a wide array of concepts and modules. The styling and asthetics are achieved with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and several npm custom scripts such as [Typical](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typical) and [react-social-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-icons). The hosting is done through Netlify and [craco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco) was used in order to allow TailwindCSS which doesnt nativly support the newest version of react. [React-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) was essential for the functionality and navigation throughout the website. [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) was used as the content management system to allow for smooth updating of content on the portfolio. I used a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO7_jgzVgbc) by Traversy Media to setup the original layout and Sanity implementation.
